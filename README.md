Hello everyone My name is EggZys. 
Here is some information about me:
I started studying programming relatively recently, at the age of 14. At the moment, I am 16 and I am developing Discord bots and integrating AI into them. 
At the moment I have 1 semi-finished project.
Bot Botovich - https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1254816334882144357&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot

I am currently developing a GUI for AI based on the AI/ML API called AppGPT. Read more in my profile.

Interesting fact:
My first Python project was a Login system.

I don't consider myself any kind of cool or anything like that. An ordinary 16-year-old guy who writes stuff on python.

In the future, I want to start learning Java Script.

Thanks for your attention! Adios!
